Key Management Recommendation

I recommend to use a password manager for the storage and creation of passwords.
A password manager creates more secure passwords than most humans.
The master password should be a very strong password.

When a (private or business) user has a big amount of tokens in their wallet they should consider buying a hardware wallet (Ledger nano for example).
This stores the private key encrypted on a small offline device.

Private & Business Users:
I recommend to keep a physical copy of the 24 recovery words (written down on paper) and store it safely (in a safe for example)
This way you can always restore your wallet and you won't lose any tokens.

Business Users:
Businesses are recommended to use a multisigniture wallet to store tokens. This wallet requires multiple addresses to verify a transaction.
Most fraud can be prevented that way.

Whenever you want to share your wallet with another person I also recommend a multisig wallet.
Transactions can be tracked per signature.
